    <h2>Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones</h2>
    
    <div class="author">
        <p>by James Clear (Author)  </p>
        <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>

    <hr>
    <h3>The #1 New York Times bestseller. Over 20 million copies sold!</h3>
    <h3>Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results</h3>
    
    <p>No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.</p>
    <p>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p>
    <p>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p>
    <p>Learn how to:
        <ul class="nobullets">
            <li>make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);</li>
            <li>overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;</li>
            <li>design your environment to make success easier;</li>
            <li>get back on track when you fall off course;</li>
           </ul>
           ...and much more.
    </p>

    <p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>

    <h2>Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</h2>

    <hr>
    <h3>INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER • 2 MILLION+ COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE</h3>
    <h3>“Workers looking for more fulfilling positions should start by identifying their ikigai.” ―Business Insider</h3>
    <h3>“One of the unintended—yet positive—consequences of the [pandemic] is that it is forcing people to reevaluate their jobs, careers, and lives. Use this time wisely, find your personal ikigai, and live your best life.” ―Forbes</h3>
    <h3>Find your ikigai (pronounced ee-key-guy) to live longer and bring more meaning and joy to all your days.</h3>
    <h3>“Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.” —Japanese proverb</h3>
 
    <p>According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—a reason for living. And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the world's longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigai—where what you love, what you're good at, what you can get paid for, and what the world needs all overlap—means that each day is infused with meaning. It's the reason we get up in the morning. It's also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact there's no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because they've found a real purpose in life—the happiness of always being busy.</p>
    <p>In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds—one of the world's Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, and—their best-kept secret—how they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesn't want to find happiness in every day?</p>

    <h3>Jay Shetty, social media superstar and host of the #1 podcast On Purpose, distills the timeless wisdom he learned as a monk into practical steps anyone can take every day to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.</h3>
    <p>
        <ul class="nobullets1">
            <li>When you think like a monk, you'll understand:</li>
            <li>-How to overcome negativity</li>
            <li>-How to stop overthinking</li>
            <li>-Why comparison kills love</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Shetty grew up in a family where you could become one of three things—a doctor, a lawyer, or a failure. His family was convinced he had chosen option three: instead of attending his college graduation ceremony, he headed to India to become a monk, to meditate every day for four to eight hours, and devote his life to helping others. After three years, one of his teachers told him that he would have more impact on the world if he left the monk's path to share his experience and wisdom with others. Heavily in debt, and with no recognizable skills on his résumé, he moved back home in north London with his parents.</p>
    <p>Shetty reconnected with old school friends—many working for some of the world's largest corporations—who were experiencing tremendous stress, pressure, and unhappiness, and they invited Shetty to coach them on well-being, purpose, and mindfulness. Since then, Shetty has become one of the world's most popular influencers. In 2017, he was named in the Forbes magazine 30-under-30 for being a game-changer in the world of media. In 2018, he had the #1 video on Facebook with over 360 million views. His social media following totals over 38 million, he has produced over 400 viral videos which have amassed more than 8 billion views, and his podcast, On Purpose, is consistently ranked the world's #1 Health and Wellness podcast.</p>
    <p>In this inspiring, empowering book, Shetty draws on his time as a monk to show us how we can clear the roadblocks to our potential and power. Combining ancient wisdom and his own rich experiences in the ashram, Think Like a Monk reveals how to overcome negative thoughts and habits, and access the calm and purpose that lie within all of us. He transforms abstract lessons into advice and exercises we can all apply to reduce stress, improve relationships, and give the gifts we find in ourselves to the world. Shetty proves that everyone can—and should—think like a monk.</p>
