    <h2>MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom </h2>
    
    <div class="author">
        <p>by Tony Robbins (Author)  </p>
        <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>
        </div>
   
    <hr>
   <h3>Tony Robbins turns to the topic that vexes us all: How to secure financial freedom for ourselves and for our families. “If there were a Pulitzer Prize for investment books, this one would win, hands down” (Forbes).</h3>
   <p>Tony Robbins is one of the most revered writers and thinkers of our time. People from all over the world—from the disadvantaged to the well-heeled, from twenty-somethings to retirees—credit him for giving them the inspiration and the tools for transforming their lives. From diet and fitness, to business and leadership, to relationships and self-respect, Tony Robbins's books have changed people in profound and lasting ways. Now, for the first time, he has assembled an invaluable “distillation of just about every good personal finance idea of the last forty years” (The New York Times).</p>
   <p>Based on extensive research and interviews with some of the most legendary investors at work today (John Bogle, Warren Buffett, Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, and many others), Tony Robbins has created a 7-step blueprint for securing financial freedom. With advice about taking control of your financial decisions, to setting up a savings and investing plan, to destroying myths about what it takes to save and invest, to setting up a “lifetime income plan,” the book brims with advice and practices for making the financial game not only winnable—but providing financial freedom for the rest of your life. “Put MONEY on your short list of new books to read…It's that good” (Marketwatch.com).</p>

    <h2>Financial Freedom: A Proven Path to All the Money You Will Ever Need</h2>
    
    <div class="author">
        <p>by Grant Sabatier (Author), Vicki Robin (Foreword)   </p>
        <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>
        </div>
   
    <hr>
   <h3>The International Bestseller</h3>
   <h3>New York Public Library's "Top 10 Think Thrifty Reads of 2023"</h3>
   <h3>"This book blew my mind. More importantly, it made financial independence seem achievable. I read Financial Freedom three times, cover-to-cover." 
    —Lifehacker</h3>
   <h3>Money is unlimited. Time is not. Become financially independent as fast as possible.</h3>

   <p>In 2010, 24-year old Grant Sabatier woke up to find he had $2.26 in his bank account. Five years later, he had a net worth of over $1.25 million, and CNBC began calling him "the Millennial Millionaire." By age 30, he had reached financial independence. Along the way he uncovered that most of the accepted wisdom about money, work, and retirement is either incorrect, incomplete, or so old-school it's obsolete.</p>
   <p>Financial Freedom is a step-by-step path to make more money in less time, so you have more time for the things you love. It challenges the accepted narrative of spending decades working a traditional 9 to 5 job, pinching pennies, and finally earning the right to retirement at age 65, and instead offers readers an alternative: forget everything you've ever learned about money so that you can actually live the life you want.</p>
   <p>Sabatier offers surprising, counter-intuitive advice on topics such as how to:
    <ul>
        <li>Create profitable side hustles that you can turn into passive income streams or full-time businesses</li>
        <li>Save money without giving up what makes you happy</li>
        <li>Negotiate more out of your employer than you thought possible</li>
        <li>Travel the world for less</li>
        <li>Live for free--or better yet, make money on your living situation</li>
        <li>Create a simple, money-making portfolio that only needs minor adjustments</li>
        <li>Think creatively--there are so many ways to make money, but we don't see them.</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
   <p>But most importantly, Sabatier highlights that, while one's ability to make money is limitless, one's time is not. There's also a limit to how much you can save, but not to how much money you can make. No one should spend precious years working at a job they dislike or worrying about how to make ends meet. Perhaps the biggest surprise: You need less money to "retire" at age 30 than you do at age 65.</p>
   <p>Financial Freedom is not merely a laundry list of advice to follow to get rich quick--it's a practical roadmap to living life on one's own terms, as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>The Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime</h2>

    <hr>
    <h3>*** International Best-Seller, Over 1,000,000 Sold: Translated/Published In Over 25 Languages</h3>
    <p>Has the financial plan of mediocrity and survival become your plan for wealth? That sounds something like this:</p>
    <h3>"Graduate from college, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit buying expensive Starbucks coffee, save and penny-pinch for decades, trust your life-savings to Wall Street, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich."</h3>

    <p>Since you were old enough to hold a job, you've been hoodwinked into believing that wealth can be created by blindly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This soul-sucking, dream-stealing dogma is known as the "The Slowlane" - a risky financial gamble that dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair.</p>
    <p>Accept the Slowlane as your financial roadmap, and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can get a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn't tank, HOPE for a robust economy, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE. Do you really want HOPE as the centerpiece for your family's financial plan?</p>
    <p>Drive the Slowlane, and you will discover your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do versus what you can. For those who refuse the lifetime subscription to mediocrity, there's an expressway to extraordinary wealth capable of burning a trail to financial freedom faster than any road out there. And shockingly, this road has nothing to do with jobs, 401(k)s, indexed-funds, or a lifestyle of miserly living in a tiny house.</p>
    <p>Just some of what you will learn:</p>
    <p>
        <ul class="nobullets">
        <li>Why jobs, 401(k)s, indexed-funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young.</li>
        <li>Why a Fastlane strategy is the best insurance policy again inflation, economic recessions, and pandemic lockdowns.</li>
        <li>Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor.</li>
        <li>The real law of wealth: Leverage this, and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you.</li>
        <li>The leading cause of poorness: Change this, and you change everything.</li>
        <li>How the rich really get rich - and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match.</li>
        <li>The indisputable mathematics of wealth is how you and any "Joe Schmo" can quickly tap into real wealth.</li>
        <li>Why the guru's sacred deities - compound interest and indexed fund investing - are impotent wealth accelerators.</li>
        <li>Why popular guru platitudes like "do what you love" and "follow your passion" will most likely keep you poor, not rich.</li>
        <li>And 250+ more poverty-busting distinctions...</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>NEWSFLASH! Your mainstream financial guru who's on 500 radio stations and lives in a $10,000,000 mansion isn't rich because he religiously follows his own advice-- he's rich because he's sold it to enough fools who believe it... in other words, he's driving The Millionaire Fastlane. Demand more. Demand the truth. Change lanes and find your explosive wealth accelerator. Hit the Fastlane, crack the code to wealth, and educate yourself on living rich for a lifetime.</p>
