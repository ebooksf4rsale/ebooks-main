    <h2>The 80/20 Principle, Third Edition: The Secret to Achieving More with Less</h2>
    
    <div class="author">
      <p>by Richard Koch (Author)   </p>
      <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>
      </div>
   
    <hr>
   <h3>Be more effective with less effort by learning how to identify and leverage the 80/20 principle: that 80 percent of all our results in business and in life stem from a mere 20 percent of our efforts.</h3>
   <p>The 80/20 principle is one of the great secrets of highly effective people and organizations.</p>
   <p>Did you know, for example, that 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of revenues? That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today's business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principle works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and our companies.</p>
   <p>The unspoken corollary to the 80/20 principle is that little of what we spend our time on actually counts. But by concentrating on those things that do, we can unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, and transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives.</p>

    <h2>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</h2>
    
    <div class="author">
      <p>by Daniel Goleman (Author)   </p>
      <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>
      </div>
   
    <hr>
   <h3>#1 BESTSELLER • The groundbreaking book that redefines what it means to be smart, with a new introduction by the author</h3>
   <h3>“A thoughtfully written, persuasive account explaining emotional intelligence and why it can be crucial.”—USA Today</h3>

   <p>Everyone knows that high IQ is no guarantee of success, happiness, or virtue, but until Emotional Intelligence, we could only guess why. Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. But why is emotional intelligence important?</p>
   <p>Drawing on groundbreaking brain and behavioral research, Goleman shows the factors at work when people of high IQ flounder and those of modest IQ do surprisingly well. These factors, which include self-awareness, self-discipline, and empathy, add up to a different way of being smart—and they aren't fixed at birth. Although shaped by childhood experiences, emotional intelligence can be nurtured and strengthened throughout our adulthood—with immediate benefits to our health, our relationships, and our work. </p>
   <p>The twenty-fifth-anniversary edition of Emotional Intelligence could not come at a better time—we spend so much of our time online, more and more jobs are becoming automated and digitized, and our children are picking up new technology faster than we ever imagined. With a new introduction from the author, the twenty-fifth-anniversary edition prepares readers, now more than ever, to reach their fullest potential and stand out from the pack with the help of EI.</p>

    <h2>The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness</h2>
    
    <div class="author">
      <p>by Morgan Housel (Author)   </p>
      <p>Format: <span>PDF</span></p>
      </div>
   
    <hr>
   <p></p>Over 6 million copies sold around the world. The original book from Morgan Housel, the New York Times bestselling author of Same As Ever.
   <p>Doing well with money isn't necessarily about what you know. It's about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.</p>
   <p>Money – investing, personal finance, and business decisions – is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don't make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.</p>
   <p>In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life's most important topics.</p>
